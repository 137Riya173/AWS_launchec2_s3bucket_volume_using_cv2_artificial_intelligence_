🚀 **Gesture-Controlled AWS Services with Python**

Explore my innovative Python project that empowers you to interact with AWS services through simple hand gestures! With the magic of computer vision and cloud computing, you can now control AWS with the wave of your hand.

🤖 **Key Features:**
- ✋ **EC2 Control**: Raise all five fingers to simultaneously launch up to five EC2 instances.
- 👆 **S3 Bucket Creation**: Lift your index finger to effortlessly create an S3 bucket.
- ✌️ **Object Upload to S3**: Elevate both your index and middle fingers to upload objects to the S3 bucket.
- 💬 **Interactive Feedback**: When no gesture is detected, the program playfully responds with "IDK" (I Don't Know).
- 🔄 **Loop Control**: The program operates in a continuous loop, and you can exit it gracefully by pressing the "Enter" key.

🔧 **Technologies Used:**
- 💻 **Python**: The project is built using Python.
- 📷 **OpenCV (cv2)**: For real-time computer vision and gesture recognition.
- 🤖 **cvzone Library**: To simplify gesture recognition in your applications.
- ☁️ **AWS SDK (Boto3)**: For seamless interaction with AWS services.

🚀 Ready to try it out? Dive into the code, experiment with your gestures, and take full control of AWS services using just your hand movements!
